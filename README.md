## 👋 Hi

My name is Adam but you can call me Mefyy. I love writing code and making APIs.

😞 I *hate* working on anything related to graphics. So don't ask me if I can desing you something.

❤️ I *love* creating the magic behind these graphics, that is, the backends and what bridges them and consumers of the data they provide.

ℹ️ I mainly **write** `Java` and `JavaScript`. I also have some minor experience writing `HTML`, `CSS`, `Python`, and a few other languages.

💬 I **speak** `Italian` (native), `English` (upper-intermediate), `French` (native), `Spanish` (basic). Capable of comprehending very-very basic `Arab`.



## 📝 My most interesting projects

* [**Mefy's APIs**](https://mefysapi.tk) — a website to get APIs for your needs, and obviously, to pay at the end of the month based on how much requests you've made.
* [**The Inazuma Pit**](https://discord.gg/9qnwUqkm9Y) — a full remake of the Hypixel minigame, The Pit.
