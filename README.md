## 👋 Hi

My name is Adam but ypu can call me Mefyy. I love writing server- and networking-bound software. 

😞 I *hate* working on anything related to graphics. So don't ask me if I can draw something

❤️ I *love* creating the magic behind these graphics, that is, the backends and what bridges them and consumers of the data they provide.

ℹ️ I mainly **write** `Javascript` and `Java`. I also have some minor experience writing `HTML`, `CSS`, `Python`, and a few other languages.

💬 I **speak** `Italian` (native), `English` (upper-intermediate), `French` (native), `Spanish` (basic). Capable of comprehending very-very basic `Arab`.
